# fileEmailer
My first "from idea to working program" python project




So, I alternate between my Macbook and my PC frequently since I use each for different tasks. For example, I design my website's project photos on my laptop, but update my site using my PC (meaning I have to send files over). I also write my papers/assignments on my PC but send them to friends over text (I don't know my friends' emails, we don't email each other lol).

Often this results in me spending more time than I'd like sending myself files through email since I don't use Dropbox/Drive file stream/others for one reason or another. This can take away from my immersion when working on a project and can impact my focus as well. I found myself wondering how I'd go about automating this task using Python, to save some significant time and to prevent losing focus when task switching. What if as soon as I saved my file to a specific location my program would attach it as an email and send it to myself so within seconds I could text a friend the file?... without leaving the project I'm working on, of course.
